When you click on any one of the following to fetch the data:- 
1) Button
2) Tab bar
3) Menu Bar
4) Dropdown Menu
5) Sidebar menu
6) Image Thumbnail
7) Video Thumbnail
8) Google Map
9) A Card Item etc 
10) Tables (Click to filter, fetch specific category data etc).

2 things can happen:-
#1) We directly write a clickHandler Function on the item user has clicked to handle the user request.
#2) Load a complete new page through routing. 

In the both cases we have to call the action creators(This is called as dispathcing an action.)
case 1:- If you are writing a clickhandler function you will call the actions from the the click handler function. 
case 2: If you are loading a new page or a new component then you will call the action creators from the componentDidMount() method.

Q) What are Action Creators?
A) Action creators are pure JS functions.  
2) What do the Action Creators do ?
A) They have 2 tasks to do:-
#1) Fetch data from the server.(This is the place where we make our axios or fetch calls). You are making a request to the server in this action creator.
#2) Return a data Object fetched from the server or any other to the Reducer along with the action type. 

Q) How do you connect a Action creator to the React Component?
A)
#  install react-redux.
#We import {connect} method from react-redux. It is a HOC. We wrap the entire react component into the connect() method. 
#We pass the action creators into the connect method.

#export default connect(mapStateToprops,mapDispatchToProps)(Profiles);

export default connect(mapStateToprops,{getProfilesAction})(Profiles);

Q) What is a reducer?
A) A reducer is a pure function with switch case statements. 
# It takes 


Redux is a unidirectional data flow . comp-> actions->reducer->store->comp
# mapDispatchToProps => To call action creators ,
{list of action creators}
# mapStateToProps => To fetch data from redux.
