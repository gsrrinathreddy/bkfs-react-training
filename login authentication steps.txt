LOGIN AUTHENTICATION

STEP 1: USER REGISTERS
STEP 2: After Successfully registering when user Logins the server responds with a JWT token

STEP 3: We have to store this token in the Local Storage. 

STEP 4: We have to assign this token as header in axios. 

axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = token;

STEP 5: Decode the token to retrieve the user information.

STEP 6: Dispatch this information(username , user id etc) to the reducer 

STEP 7: Any component can access the data from the reducer by connecting to it and through mapStateToProps.
