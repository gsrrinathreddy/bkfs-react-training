1) create package.json file 
$ npm init => (will create the package.json file for the application. It prompts you inbetween for few questions- either answer or leave it).

2) Create a src folder. 
3) Outside the src folder - create the following files
# .babelrc (This is the most important key file - this holds all the presets(transpiling lib) which actually convert your typescript code into js). 
=> @babel/presets-env @babel/presets-react @babel/presets-react-dom
# webpack.dev.config.js (FOr development mode).
# webpack.prod.config.js (for production mode).
# webpack.server.config.js(If you have server also on the same project folder)
